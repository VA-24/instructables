## How To Build a Github Pages Website:

Once you've created a GitHub account, the first thing you want to do when creating a GitHub Pages Website is to build a repository.

You can do this by logging on to GitHub.com, and then clicking the green button on the homepage labeled, “New repository."

Make sure to initialize the repository with a README.
